# scripts
A collection of bash scripts I've written.

chkdif - Simple script that checks for differences between files using diff suppress-common-lines side-by-side
mkalias - Simple script that adds aliases to .bash_aliases file
rosbld - Script that creates packages in a Catkin workspace for ROS projects. Uses absolute pathing, so atm User must edit line 15 to match path to catkin_ws
rsbld - Similar to rosbld, except uses pwd to determine HOME_DIR. Must be placed in catkin_wsthedamncat@tdc-linux-part:~/Desktop/GitHub/scripts$ echo .
