# scripts
## A collection of bash scripts I've written.

- [chkdif](./chkdif) - Simple script that checks for differences between files using diff suppress-common-lines side-by-side
- [mkalias](./mkalias) - Simple script that adds aliases to .bash_aliases file
- [rosbld](./rosbld) - Script that creates packages in a Catkin workspace for ROS projects.
