# scripts
A collection of bash scripts I've written.

[mkalias](https://github.com/mlestes/scripts/blob/master/mkalias) - Simple script that adds aliases to .bash_aliases file

[rosbld](https://github.com/mlestes/scripts/blob/master/rosbld) - Script that creates packages in a Catkin workspace for ROS projects.
